# Job Portal

Job Portal is a **MERN Stack** based web application designed to streamline the employment process. It allows users to choose their role as either an **applicant** or **recruiter**, and create an account. The app provides persistent login sessions and secures REST APIs using **JWT token verification**.

Once logged in:
- A recruiter can post job openings, shortlist, or reject applications.
- An applicant can view available jobs with various filters, apply for jobs, and manage their applications.

Additionally, users can upload, view, and edit profiles and resumes, making this platform an **all-in-one solution** for job application management.
